# MDEditor
Markdown Editor, developed with HTML5. Support real time preview and code hightlighting. This repo is inspired by 
[marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked), and is actually use it to render the markdown codes to html.

The reason for developing this repo is that I find it painful when rendering the md code to html elements with `marked` while keeping their coresponding 
relationship, i.e. which markdown code block is rendered into which html element. This repo is built upon `marked` and provides a ready-to-use
editor which is able to show real time preview. [hightlight.js](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js) is also put into use for code rendering.
